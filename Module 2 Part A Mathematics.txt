Q1) Arrange the following in increasing order:

 	0.1, 0.9, 0.5, 0.7
		(a) 0.7< 0.5< 0.1< 0.9
		(b) 0.1 <0.5 <0.7 <0.9
		(c) 0.5 <0.1 <0.7 <0.9
		(d) 0.9 <0.5 <0.1 <0.7

Answer: (a)

If answer is true Grade_math += 1 
If wrong Grade =+

Q4) Shreya measured the angles in a triangle which came out to be  60°, 50°, and 70° respectively. Now she wants to know what type of triangle it is.
Can you tell what type of triangle it is?

	(a) Acute angled triangle

	(b)Obtuse angled triangle

	(c)Right angled triangle

	(d)Reflex angled triangle

Answer (D)

Q5)There is a 2 - D plane filled with 3 digit, 2 digit and single digit numbers. A, B and C are 3 digit numbers. The digit at the hundreds place is the head and the digit at units place is tail of the number. There are no mirrors in this plane. So, no number can see its own tail. A, B and C are good friends. Since, A can see B's and C's tail, it tells them that they both are divisible by 4. B and C tell A that it is divisible by 2. One day a 3D Mathematician comes and adds A, B and C to form a 4 digit number. This new number (A + B + C), must be divisible by:

	(a)2

	(b)4

	(c)2 and 4

	(d)8
Answer : (A)
