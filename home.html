	<p style="font-size: 20px">         Find a job you love, and you will never work a day in your life
	 It's an old saying that may resonate with you if you're in the middle of trying to figure out what to do with your life. 

	 If you choose the right career, you will actually like going to work every day? Imagine that! It sounds like a magical antidote to a life of drudgery.

    It's no wonder the task of picking an occupation may seem overwhelming. With thousands of careers to choose from, how do you pick one that will make you feel like you aren't even working? Maybe that's a bit of an exaggeration, but it would at least be nice to work at a job you like going to most of the time. To find the right career, choose one that suits your interests, aptitudes, work-related values, and personality type. While you should also consider earnings, job outlook, and duties, nothing contributes more to job satisfaction than matching your occupation to your character traits and motivations.

<p style="font-size: 20px">You don’t know what you’re qualified to do. Frankly, you’ve been so busy worrying about your current job that you haven’t taken half an hour to consider what you’d rather be doing. And when you do start to think about it? Your mind morphs into a cloudy mess of overwhelm.</p>
</p>
<p style="font-size: 20px">As you’re thinking through your career change, I’d encourage you not to let fear or insecurities about your skillset hold you back and to think big about the possibilities that are out there. Sure—if you’re a communications professional who’s fascinated by the law, becoming an attorney can be a long and difficult road ahead. But why not consider it? The road might not be as long as you imagine (and it definitely can be worth it). But, also pay attention to specifically what about the law gets you excited. Is it in-depth research? Helping other people? Arguing a case? There are plenty of other professions where you could combine your current skills with your passions to do those things, sans law degree.</p>
